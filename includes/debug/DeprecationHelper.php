 * Example usage:
 *     class Foo {
 *         use DeprecationHelper;
 *         protected $bar;
 *         public function __construct() {
 *             $this->deprecatePublicProperty( 'bar', '1.21', __CLASS__ );
 *         }
 *     }
 *
 *     $foo = new Foo;
 *     $foo->bar; // works but logs a warning
 *
 * Cannot be used with classes that have their own __get/__set methods.
 *
 * @since 1.32
