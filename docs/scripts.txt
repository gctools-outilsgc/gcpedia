scripts.txt

MediaWiki primary scripts are in the root directory of the software. Users
should only use these scripts to access the wiki. There are also some .php that
aren't primary scripts but helper files and won't work if they are accessed
directly by the web.

Primary scripts:

  index.php
    Main access point. It handles the most of requests.
    See https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Index.php

  api.php
    Script to provide an API for bots to fetch content and informations about
    the site and also modify it. See https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API
    for more informations.

  img_auth.php
    Script that only serve images to logged in users. To configure the wiki
    to use that script, see https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Image_Authorisation.

  load.php
    Used by ResourceLoader to serve minified, concatenated and gzipped CSS and JS.

  opensearch_desc.php
    Returns a OpenSearch description document (see http://www.opensearch.org/)
    that points to the search engines of the wiki.

  profileinfo.php
    Simple interface for displaying request profiles that were stored in the
    database. For more information, see the documentation in that file, and at
    https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Profiling.

  thumb.php
    Script used to resize images if it is configured to be done when the web
    browser requests the image and not when generating the page. This script can
    be used as a 404 handler to generate image thumbs when they don't exist.
