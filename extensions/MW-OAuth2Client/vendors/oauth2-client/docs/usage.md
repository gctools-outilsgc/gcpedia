Basic Usage
=============

> Note: In most cases, you'll be much better served by using a specific [official](/providers/league) or [third-party](/providers/thirdparty)
provider client library rather than this base library alone.

Authorization Code Flow
-------------------------

The following example uses the out-of-the-box `GenericProvider` provided by this library. 

The authorization code grant type is the most common grant type used when authenticating users with a third-party service. This grant type utilizes a client (this library), a server (the service provider), and a resource owner (the user with credentials to a protected—or owned—resource) to request access to resources owned by the user. This is often referred to as _3-legged OAuth_, since there are three parties involved.

The following example illustrates this using [Brent Shaffer's](https://github.com/bshaffer) demo OAuth 2.0 application named **Lock'd In**. When running this code, you will be redirected to Lock'd In, where you'll be prompted to authorize the client to make requests to a resource on your behalf.

Now, you don't really have an account on Lock'd In, but for the sake of this example, imagine that you are already logged in on Lock'd In when you are redirected there.

~~~ php
<?php

$provider = new \League\OAuth2\Client\Provider\GenericProvider([
    'clientId'                => 'demoapp',    // The client ID assigned to you by the provider
    'clientSecret'            => 'demopass',   // The client password assigned to you by the provider
    'redirectUri'             => 'http://example.com/your-redirect-url/',
    'urlAuthorize'            => 'http://brentertainment.com/oauth2/lockdin/authorize',
    'urlAccessToken'          => 'http://brentertainment.com/oauth2/lockdin/token',
    'urlResourceOwnerDetails' => 'http://brentertainment.com/oauth2/lockdin/resource'
]);

// If we don't have an authorization code then get one
if (!isset($_GET['code'])) {

    // Fetch the authorization URL from the provider; this returns the
    // urlAuthorize option and generates and applies any necessary parameters
    // (e.g. state).
    $authorizationUrl = $provider->getAuthorizationUrl();

    // Get the state generated for you and store it to the session.
    $_SESSION['oauth2state'] = $provider->getState();

    // Redirect the user to the authorization URL.
    header('Location: ' . $authorizationUrl);
    exit;

// Check given state against previously stored one to mitigate CSRF attack
} elseif (empty($_GET['state']) || ($_GET['state'] !== $_SESSION['oauth2state'])) {

    unset($_SESSION['oauth2state']);
    exit('Invalid state');

} else {

    try {

        // Try to get an access token using the authorization code grant.
        $accessToken = $provider->getAccessToken('authorization_code', [
            'code' => $_GET['code']
        ]);

        // We have an access token, which we may use in authenticated
        // requests against the service provider's API.
        echo $accessToken->getToken() . "\n";
        echo $accessToken->getRefreshToken() . "\n";
        echo $accessToken->getExpires() . "\n";
        echo ($accessToken->hasExpired() ? 'expired' : 'not expired') . "\n";

        // Using the access token, we may look up details about the
        // resource owner.
        $resourceOwner = $provider->getResourceOwner($accessToken);

        var_export($resourceOwner->toArray());

        // The provider provides a way to get an authenticated API request for
        // the service, using the access token; it returns an object conforming
        // to Psr\Http\Message\RequestInterface.
        $request = $provider->getAuthenticatedRequest(
            'GET',
            'http://brentertainment.com/oauth2/lockdin/resource',
            $accessToken
        );

    } catch (\League\OAuth2\Client\Provider\Exception\IdentityProviderException $e) {

        // Failed to get the access token or user details.
        exit($e->getMessage());

    }

}

Refreshing a Token
-------------------

Once your application is authorized, you can refresh an expired token using a refresh token rather than going through the entire process of obtaining a brand new token. To do so, simply reuse this refresh token from your data store to request a refresh.

_This example uses [Brent Shaffer's](https://github.com/bshaffer) demo OAuth 2.0 application named **Lock'd In**. See authorization code example above, for more details._

~~~ php
<?php

$provider = new \League\OAuth2\Client\Provider\GenericProvider([
    'clientId'                => 'demoapp',    // The client ID assigned to you by the provider
    'clientSecret'            => 'demopass',   // The client password assigned to you by the provider
    'redirectUri'             => 'http://example.com/your-redirect-url/',
    'urlAuthorize'            => 'http://brentertainment.com/oauth2/lockdin/authorize',
    'urlAccessToken'          => 'http://brentertainment.com/oauth2/lockdin/token',
    'urlResourceOwnerDetails' => 'http://brentertainment.com/oauth2/lockdin/resource'
]);

$existingAccessToken = getAccessTokenFromYourDataStore();

if ($existingAccessToken->hasExpired()) {
    $newAccessToken = $provider->getAccessToken('refresh_token', [
        'refresh_token' => $existingAccessToken->getRefreshToken()
    ]);

    // Purge old access token and store new access token to your data store.
}
