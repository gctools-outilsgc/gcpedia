The OAuth2 login flow, seen commonly around the web in the form of "Connect with Facebook/Google/etc." buttons, is a very
common integration added to web applications, that can be a bit tricky and tedious to do right.

The `league/oauth2-client` package provides an easy base for integration with various OAuth 2.0 Providers around the web,
without overburdening your application with the concerns of [RFC 6749](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749).

Installation
-------------

This package establishes a convenient base of interfaces and abstract classes that allow developers to easily create
OAuth2 Clients to interface with a wide-variety of providers on the web. There are many clients that exist that you may
use on the [Third-Party Providers](/providers/thirdparty) page.

This base package also includes a `GenericProvider` that can be used with any OAuth 2.0 Server that uses [Bearer tokens](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750).

If you would like to simply use that, you can install this package via composer.

~~~ bash
$ composer require league/oauth2-client
~~~
