Official Providers
===============================

Due to the vast (and ever-growing) number of OAuth 2.0 services that exist, it would be impossible to maintain first-party
support for every OAuth 2 provider without damaging our ability to make this package the best it can be. Therefore we will only accept
very high-quality providers into the `league` namespace on a case-by-case basis. You can find some of the criteria on the 
[third-party providers page](/providers/thirdparty)

There are a [large number of community packages](/providers/thirdparty) that interface with other systems.

Installation of any of these packages can be done with composer:

~~~ bash
$ composer require league/<package-name>
~~~
